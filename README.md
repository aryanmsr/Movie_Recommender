This [notebook](https://github.com/aryanmsr/Movie_Recommender/blob/main/movie_recommendation_system.Rmd) contains the code used to build a basic movie recommendation 
system that utilizes User-Based Collaborative Filtering to predict user ratings of movies. Refer to my research [paper](https://github.com/aryanmsr/Movie_Recommender/blob/main/am5696_Application_of_User_Based_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Streaming_Recommendations.pdf)
for more details.

As always, any feedback, queries or concerns regarding this notebook are highly apprecaited. Feel free to email me at aryanmsr@gmail.com.

### Introduction (from Research Paper)

*Recommendation systems are an interesting and integral part of modern machine learning
systems that generally deal with rankings and ratings of various users and items. In fact, the
growing popularity of the Internet as a medium for electronic and business transactions has fueled
the advancement of recommender system technology. The simplicity with which the Web allows
consumers to submit feedback about their likes and dislikes is a key catalyst in this regard. This is
especially important for streaming platforms such as Netflix and Disney+, whose business models
are based on monthly subscriptions. In this accord, recommender systems help maintain and
improve user retention by ensuring that users receive regular recommendations that align with
their preferences. Apart from improving user retention, recommendation systems also allow
streaming platforms to easily analyze the market by discovering user preferences. By leveraging
user ratings and the number of people watching a particular movie, streaming platforms can
recommend similar movies, which can enhance user experience and lead to additional sales and
profit for streaming platforms in general.*

*Taking these observations into account, the goal of this research paper is to explore and analyze
the application of a particular type of recommendation technique, called User-Based
Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), for streaming recommendations (in particular movie
recommendations). Throughout this paper, we will first look at how the data was acquired and
perform some basic exploratory data analysis. This will be then be followed by UBCF modeling,
predictions and evaluation, conclusion, and possible improvements to the recommendation
system.*
